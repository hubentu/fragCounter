Title: GC mappability correction and segmentation
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person(given = "Marcin", family = "Imielinski", email = "mimielinski@nygenome.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: GC bias curve is determined by loess regression of read count by GC and mappability scores. Segmentation is done by circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm after getting tumor/normal ratios of corrected read counts.
